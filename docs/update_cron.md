# Python script for updating crontab (argo-web-api --> crontab)

Having an updated configuration from argo-web-api, argo engine can automatically
create all necessary crontab entries for batch a/r and status jobs covering
all tenants and all reports.

To manually trigger a crontab update (using latest engine configuration) issue:
`./bin/utils/update_cron.py -c /path/to/argo-streaming.conf`

Script will read the designated `argo-streaming.conf` and extract information
for all supported Tenants and reports. For each tenant and report will generate
a combination of daily and hourly crontab entries for scheduling a/r and status
job submissions.

After running the script a new section will be appended at the end of the crontab
beginning with the line as seen below:

```
...
#The rest are generated by argo engine at 2018-07-17 09:35:24.787980
#Jobs for TENANT_A

#TENANT_A:report1 hourly A/R
...
```
